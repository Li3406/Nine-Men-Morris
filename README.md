# Nine Men's Morris Game

## Overview
Nine Men's Morris is a strategy board game for two players dating back to the Roman Empire. The objective is to form 'mills'—three of your pieces lined horizontally or vertically—allowing you to remove an opponent's piece from the game. The game proceeds in three phases: placing pieces, moving pieces, and jumping (if a player has only three pieces left).
